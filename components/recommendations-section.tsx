They brought fresh, creative ideas to our school's Instagram and consistently produced high-quality, engaging content. Their editing skills are top-notch, and they always delivered on time with a great attitude. Reliable, creative, and drivenâ€”any organisation would be lucky to have them, especially with their ability to stay up to date with trending content and produce their own spin on things.",
